# Portfolio Project

![Project](https://i.imgur.com/H4CCEGe.jpg)

* **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I'm using NextJS to render pages server-side, which is better for SEO.
* **Database**: [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/). Because the website is small, creating my own content management system wouldn't make sense. I like GraphCMS because of visual schema & query editing interfaces, and its easy integration with NextJS via API.
* **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that saves time thanks to styling all elements right in HTML itself.

This is a personal  portfolio website, built with Next.js, GraphCMS, Tailwind CSS. The content is managed through GraphCMS and accessed via GraphQL endpoints.

The purpose of this portfolio is to introduce myself, my coding style, and show off a little bit of my web development skills.
